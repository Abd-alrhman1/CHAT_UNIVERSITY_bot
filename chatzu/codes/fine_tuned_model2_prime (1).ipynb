              "  'text': '\\nThe Computer Science major emerged as a result of recent technological advancements in the world. It is defined as the discipline in which students analyze systems and algorithms, and study computer hardware, software, and the complex processes that occur within a computer. The study of this major also includes skills in planning, analysis, organization, comparison, the ability to prove, demonstrate, solve problems, and design programming languages. It is the science that studies computing, data processing, theories, and applications. The abbreviation CS is used to describe it. The Department of Computer Science was established after the founding of Zarqa University in 1994. It focuses on using theoretical and practical methods to process and transmit information via computers. Graduates are awarded a Bachelor\\'s degree in Computer Science. The department places great emphasis on the quality of education and its outcomes. It has qualified faculty members in the most important academic fields of computer science, and multiple laboratories and classrooms equipped with the latest equipment necessary to provide the best service to our students. The Computer Science major focuses on building specialized knowledge in the field of computers, preparing students to work in programming, computer networks, and the development of various computer systems in various official institutions, as well as private institutions and companies. Students also take courses that build their programming knowledge. They study a number of advanced programming languages, the foundations of designing and analyzing algorithms, data structures, object-oriented and visual programming, and database systems. They also learn about the latest methods of systems analysis and design, using the latest systems used for this purpose. The Computer Science Department includes classrooms equipped with projectors and air conditioning, and computer labs equipped with all applicable computer software, projectors, and smart boards. Finally, students complete their studies in this major by completing an applied project, employing the skills and knowledge they have learned during their undergraduate studies, thus qualifying them to successfully enter the job market.\\nSince the 2002/2003 academic year, Zarqa University has established a Software Engineering major to meet the needs of the labor market and support the community by facilitating the use of various software to meet the requirements of daily life. Studying software engineering provides students with the necessary concepts and skills needed in the job market to engineer software system requirements and then design, develop, and manage systems of various sizes and types.\\n\\nBuilding and developing computer systems requires precision, skill, and great care to avoid errors during system development that could cause material and human losses. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to facilitate the use of computer systems, both from the perspective of users and those responsible for maintaining and developing them. Therefore, the existence of a field of knowledge concerned with developing methodologies, techniques, and tools to ensure the quality and reliability of all stages of system development and that the system fulfills its intended purpose has become essential. Specialists have come to call this field of knowledge \"software engineering,\" and the specialist in this field is called a software engineer.\\n\\nThe Department of Software Engineering at Zarqa University offers a full-time undergraduate program in Software Engineering. Students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 132 credit hours. The department also offers a full-time Master\\'s program in Software Engineering, both thesis and comprehensive, and students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 33 credit hours.\\n\\nThe department includes two highly equipped laboratories, including a Software Engineering Tools Laboratory and a Terminal Laboratory, in addition to several PC laboratories. The department constantly strives to update and expand its various equipment. The various laboratories are connected via a modern fiber optic network connected to servers running Unix, Linux, and Windows. The department also includes a group of faculty members with extensive academic and practical teaching experience and a high level of research and knowledge capabilities. The Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence was established in the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year. This decision came in response to significant and significant global developments in this field. This specialization began with 25 students, and the department now includes more than 200 students enrolled in the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program.\\n\\nZarqa University has been a pioneer in this field, being the second Jordanian university to establish a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program. The program\\'s curriculum was developed after a comprehensive study of AI programs at Arab and foreign universities and an examination of the most widespread AI applications worldwide. The plan aims to enable students to build intelligent systems that can be used in various areas of life.\\n\\nThese days, the world is living under a single space (the internet) that facilitates social, economic, and other aspects of life. Therefore, it was necessary to develop academic programs that qualify students to keep pace with current developments in cyberspace by developing secure, highly efficient, and effective internet applications. Accordingly, the university decided to establish the Department of Internet Technology, starting at the beginning of the 2010/2011 academic year. Starting with the second semester of the 2021/2022 academic year, the name was changed to Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe goal of the Cybersecurity Department is to provide students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills required in the field of cybersecurity and the development of efficient and effective internet and smartphone applications. The program also seeks to address the shortage of practical skills required by the labor markets in the field of cybersecurity and technology.'},\n",

              "  'text': '\\nThe Computer Science major emerged as a result of recent technological advancements in the world. It is defined as the discipline in which students analyze systems and algorithms, and study computer hardware, software, and the complex processes that occur within a computer. The study of this major also includes skills in planning, analysis, organization, comparison, the ability to prove, demonstrate, solve problems, and design programming languages. It is the science that studies computing, data processing, theories, and applications. The abbreviation CS is used to describe it. The Department of Computer Science was established after the founding of Zarqa University in 1994. It focuses on using theoretical and practical methods to process and transmit information via computers. Graduates are awarded a Bachelor\\'s degree in Computer Science. The department places great emphasis on the quality of education and its outcomes. It has qualified faculty members in the most important academic fields of computer science, and multiple laboratories and classrooms equipped with the latest equipment necessary to provide the best service to our students. The Computer Science major focuses on building specialized knowledge in the field of computers, preparing students to work in programming, computer networks, and the development of various computer systems in various official institutions, as well as private institutions and companies. Students also take courses that build their programming knowledge. They study a number of advanced programming languages, the foundations of designing and analyzing algorithms, data structures, object-oriented and visual programming, and database systems. They also learn about the latest methods of systems analysis and design, using the latest systems used for this purpose. The Computer Science Department includes classrooms equipped with projectors and air conditioning, and computer labs equipped with all applicable computer software, projectors, and smart boards. Finally, students complete their studies in this major by completing an applied project, employing the skills and knowledge they have learned during their undergraduate studies, thus qualifying them to successfully enter the job market.\\nSince the 2002/2003 academic year, Zarqa University has established a Software Engineering major to meet the needs of the labor market and support the community by facilitating the use of various software to meet the requirements of daily life. Studying software engineering provides students with the necessary concepts and skills needed in the job market to engineer software system requirements and then design, develop, and manage systems of various sizes and types.\\n\\nBuilding and developing computer systems requires precision, skill, and great care to avoid errors during system development that could cause material and human losses. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to facilitate the use of computer systems, both from the perspective of users and those responsible for maintaining and developing them. Therefore, the existence of a field of knowledge concerned with developing methodologies, techniques, and tools to ensure the quality and reliability of all stages of system development and that the system fulfills its intended purpose has become essential. Specialists have come to call this field of knowledge \"software engineering,\" and the specialist in this field is called a software engineer.\\n\\nThe Department of Software Engineering at Zarqa University offers a full-time undergraduate program in Software Engineering. Students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 132 credit hours. The department also offers a full-time Master\\'s program in Software Engineering, both thesis and comprehensive, and students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 33 credit hours.\\n\\nThe department includes two highly equipped laboratories, including a Software Engineering Tools Laboratory and a Terminal Laboratory, in addition to several PC laboratories. The department constantly strives to update and expand its various equipment. The various laboratories are connected via a modern fiber optic network connected to servers running Unix, Linux, and Windows. The department also includes a group of faculty members with extensive academic and practical teaching experience and a high level of research and knowledge capabilities. The Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence was established in the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year. This decision came in response to significant and significant global developments in this field. This specialization began with 25 students, and the department now includes more than 200 students enrolled in the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program.\\n\\nZarqa University has been a pioneer in this field, being the second Jordanian university to establish a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program. The program\\'s curriculum was developed after a comprehensive study of AI programs at Arab and foreign universities and an examination of the most widespread AI applications worldwide. The plan aims to enable students to build intelligent systems that can be used in various areas of life.\\n\\nThese days, the world is living under a single space (the internet) that facilitates social, economic, and other aspects of life. Therefore, it was necessary to develop academic programs that qualify students to keep pace with current developments in cyberspace by developing secure, highly efficient, and effective internet applications. Accordingly, the university decided to establish the Department of Internet Technology, starting at the beginning of the 2010/2011 academic year. Starting with the second semester of the 2021/2022 academic year, the name was changed to Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe goal of the Cybersecurity Department is to provide students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills required in the field of cybersecurity and the development of efficient and effective internet and smartphone applications. The program also seeks to address the shortage of practical skills required by the labor markets in the field of cybersecurity and technology.'},\n",

This is in addition to a number of administrative units: the Library Unit, the Development and Quality Assurance Unit.\\n\\nSince its founding, the university has carried out three core functions that have defined its identity among universities: First, education, providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to enhance their academic achievement, develop their personalities comprehensively and comprehensively, prepare them for future work, and shape their positive attitudes. Second, scientific research, which is a key factor in generating knowledge, achieving scientific progress, and sustainable development. Third, community service. The university plays its role as a fundamental force in the development and modernization of society, providing its services to all sectors by opening up to local, Arab, and international community institutions and strengthening its ties with them. This is achieved by holding scientific and cultural conferences, seminars, workshops, and other events, in addition to holding training courses through its specialized centers, serving members of Jordanian, Arab, and international society alike. The university has also sought to achieve excellence and leadership by providing modern academic specializations that meet the needs of society and by working to develop its institutions, driven by its belief in its scientific, practical, and humanitarian mission. It has also attracted a group of faculty members and experts in various academic disciplines, as well as a large group of non-Jordanian students from sixty Arab and foreign nationalities. It has also incorporated information and communications technology into its facilities, operations, and administrative and academic activities, winning numerous sports championships. Furthermore, it has been chosen as the headquarters for several well-known scientific conferences and associations, such as the Arab International Conference on Information Technology (ACIT) since 2000. The General Secretariat of the Association of Faculties of Computers and Information, an offshoot of the Association of Arab Universities, has been active since mid-2007, and publishes the Arab International Journal of Information Technology (IAJIT), a journal classified by Thompson ISI. The university has also been active as the General Secretariat of the Arab International Conference on Quality Assurance in Higher Education (IACQA) since 2011.\\n\\nThe Zarqa Journal of Research and Humanities is the flagship journal. The University Journal, which began publication in 1999 by the Deanship of Scientific Research, is a peer-reviewed, indexed, and specialized scientific journal in the humanities. It is published three issues per year and publishes scientific research in both Arabic and English.\\n\\nThe University has also achieved significant accomplishments in competitions organized by the Injaz Foundation at the university level, through leadership projects that work to develop university students by providing support for these projects and overcoming the challenges facing the team both inside and outside the university. In addition, it has achieved the highest scores on university proficiency exams for a significant number of academic disciplines.\\n\\nRegarding student assistance, the University offers a range of discounts, grants, and tuition fee exemptions, reaching up to 70% for many academic disciplines. Through wise joint planning between the Board of Directors of Zarqa Education and Investment Company, the Board of Trustees, and the University Administration, and by working as one team, Zarqa University obtained the ISO certificate in 2009 among public and private universities, and also the International Crown Certificate for Quality (Gold Classification) in 2015 from Britain. In 2018, the College of Pharmacy obtained the Silver Level Quality Certificate from the Jordanian Higher Education Accreditation Commission, and in 2018, the College of Nursing obtained the Bronze Level Quality Certificate from the Jordanian Higher Education Accreditation Commission.'},\n",

              " '\\nThe Computer Science major emerged as a result of recent technological advancements in the world. It is defined as the discipline in which students analyze systems and algorithms, and study computer hardware, software, and the complex processes that occur within a computer. The study of this major also includes skills in planning, analysis, organization, comparison, the ability to prove, demonstrate, solve problems, and design programming languages. It is the science that studies computing, data processing, theories, and applications. The abbreviation CS is used to describe it. The Department of Computer Science was established after the founding of Zarqa University in 1994. It focuses on using theoretical and practical methods to process and transmit information via computers. Graduates are awarded a Bachelor\\'s degree in Computer Science. The department places great emphasis on the quality of education and its outcomes. It has qualified faculty members in the most important academic fields of computer science, and multiple laboratories and classrooms equipped with the latest equipment necessary to provide the best service to our students. The Computer Science major focuses on building specialized knowledge in the field of computers, preparing students to work in programming, computer networks, and the development of various computer systems in various official institutions, as well as private institutions and companies. Students also take courses that build their programming knowledge. They study a number of advanced programming languages, the foundations of designing and analyzing algorithms, data structures, object-oriented and visual programming, and database systems. They also learn about the latest methods of systems analysis and design, using the latest systems used for this purpose. The Computer Science Department includes classrooms equipped with projectors and air conditioning, and computer labs equipped with all applicable computer software, projectors, and smart boards. Finally, students complete their studies in this major by completing an applied project, employing the skills and knowledge they have learned during their undergraduate studies, thus qualifying them to successfully enter the job market.\\nSince the 2002/2003 academic year, Zarqa University has established a Software Engineering major to meet the needs of the labor market and support the community by facilitating the use of various software to meet the requirements of daily life. Studying software engineering provides students with the necessary concepts and skills needed in the job market to engineer software system requirements and then design, develop, and manage systems of various sizes and types.\\n\\nBuilding and developing computer systems requires precision, skill, and great care to avoid errors during system development that could cause material and human losses. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to facilitate the use of computer systems, both from the perspective of users and those responsible for maintaining and developing them. Therefore, the existence of a field of knowledge concerned with developing methodologies, techniques, and tools to ensure the quality and reliability of all stages of system development and that the system fulfills its intended purpose has become essential. Specialists have come to call this field of knowledge \"software engineering,\" and the specialist in this field is called a software engineer.\\n\\nThe Department of Software Engineering at Zarqa University offers a full-time undergraduate program in Software Engineering. Students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 132 credit hours. The department also offers a full-time Master\\'s program in Software Engineering, both thesis and comprehensive, and students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 33 credit hours.\\n\\nThe department includes two highly equipped laboratories, including a Software Engineering Tools Laboratory and a Terminal Laboratory, in addition to several PC laboratories. The department constantly strives to update and expand its various equipment. The various laboratories are connected via a modern fiber optic network connected to servers running Unix, Linux, and Windows. The department also includes a group of faculty members with extensive academic and practical teaching experience and a high level of research and knowledge capabilities. The Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence was established in the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year. This decision came in response to significant and significant global developments in this field. This specialization began with 25 students, and the department now includes more than 200 students enrolled in the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program.\\n\\nZarqa University has been a pioneer in this field, being the second Jordanian university to establish a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program. The program\\'s curriculum was developed after a comprehensive study of AI programs at Arab and foreign universities and an examination of the most widespread AI applications worldwide. The plan aims to enable students to build intelligent systems that can be used in various areas of life.\\n\\nThese days, the world is living under a single space (the internet) that facilitates social, economic, and other aspects of life. Therefore, it was necessary to develop academic programs that qualify students to keep pace with current developments in cyberspace by developing secure, highly efficient, and effective internet applications. Accordingly, the university decided to establish the Department of Internet Technology, starting at the beginning of the 2010/2011 academic year. Starting with the second semester of the 2021/2022 academic year, the name was changed to Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe goal of the Cybersecurity Department is to provide students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills required in the field of cybersecurity and the development of efficient and effective internet and smartphone applications.

It is defined as the discipline in which students analyze systems and algorithms, and study computer hardware, software, and the complex processes that occur within a computer. The study of this major also includes skills in planning, analysis, organization, comparison, the ability to prove, demonstrate, solve problems, and design programming languages. It is the science that studies computing, data processing, theories, and applications. The abbreviation CS is used to describe it. The Department of Computer Science was established after the founding of Zarqa University in 1994. It focuses on using theoretical and practical methods to process and transmit information via computers. Graduates are awarded a Bachelor\\'s degree in Computer Science. The department places great emphasis on the quality of education and its outcomes. It has qualified faculty members in the most important academic fields of computer science, and multiple laboratories and classrooms equipped with the latest equipment necessary to provide the best service to our students. The Computer Science major focuses on building specialized knowledge in the field of computers, preparing students to work in programming, computer networks, and the development of various computer systems in various official institutions, as well as private institutions and companies. Students also take courses that build their programming knowledge. They study a number of advanced programming languages, the foundations of designing and analyzing algorithms, data structures, object-oriented and visual programming, and database systems. They also learn about the latest methods of systems analysis and design, using the latest systems used for this purpose. The Computer Science Department includes classrooms equipped with projectors and air conditioning, and computer labs equipped with all applicable computer software, projectors, and smart boards. Finally, students complete their studies in this major by completing an applied project, employing the skills and knowledge they have learned during their undergraduate studies, thus qualifying them to successfully enter the job market.\\nSince the 2002/2003 academic year, Zarqa University has established a Software Engineering major to meet the needs of the labor market and support the community by facilitating the use of various software to meet the requirements of daily life. Studying software engineering provides students with the necessary concepts and skills needed in the job market to engineer software system requirements and then design, develop, and manage systems of various sizes and types.\\n\\nBuilding and developing computer systems requires precision, skill, and great care to avoid errors during system development that could cause material and human losses. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to facilitate the use of computer systems, both from the perspective of users and those responsible for maintaining and developing them. Therefore, the existence of a field of knowledge concerned with developing methodologies, techniques, and tools to ensure the quality and reliability of all stages of system development and that the system fulfills its intended purpose has become essential. Specialists have come to call this field of knowledge \"software engineering,\" and the specialist in this field is called a software engineer.\\n\\nThe Department of Software Engineering at Zarqa University offers a full-time undergraduate program in Software Engineering. Students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 132 credit hours. The department also offers a full-time Master\\'s program in Software Engineering, both thesis and comprehensive, and students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 33 credit hours.\\n\\nThe department includes two highly equipped laboratories, including a Software Engineering Tools Laboratory and a Terminal Laboratory, in addition to several PC laboratories. The department constantly strives to update and expand its various equipment. The various laboratories are connected via a modern fiber optic network connected to servers running Unix, Linux, and Windows. The department also includes a group of faculty members with extensive academic and practical teaching experience and a high level of research and knowledge capabilities. The Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence was established in the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year. This decision came in response to significant and significant global developments in this field. This specialization began with 25 students, and the department now includes more than 200 students enrolled in the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program.\\n\\nZarqa University has been a pioneer in this field, being the second Jordanian university to establish a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program. The program\\'s curriculum was developed after a comprehensive study of AI programs at Arab and foreign universities and an examination of the most widespread AI applications worldwide. The plan aims to enable students to build intelligent systems that can be used in various areas of life.\\n\\nThese days, the world is living under a single space (the internet) that facilitates social, economic, and other aspects of life. Therefore, it was necessary to develop academic programs that qualify students to keep pace with current developments in cyberspace by developing secure, highly efficient, and effective internet applications. Accordingly, the university decided to establish the Department of Internet Technology, starting at the beginning of the 2010/2011 academic year. Starting with the second semester of the 2021/2022 academic year, the name was changed to Cybersecurity.\\n\\nThe goal of the Cybersecurity Department is to provide students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills required in the field of cybersecurity and the development of efficient and effective internet and smartphone applications. The program also seeks to address the shortage of practical skills required by the labor markets in the field of cybersecurity and technology.\\n</think>\\n',\n",

Four intermittent semesters and six consecutive semesters may be postponed, but these are not counted as part of the period allowed for obtaining a bachelor\\'s degree.\\n- Is it permissible for a student who has completed university graduation requirements and wishes to raise their cumulative GPA to study courses to raise their cumulative GPA? A student who has completed the requirements for a bachelor\\'s degree before their graduation is approved by the Council of Deans may study one or more semesters to raise their cumulative GPA.\\n\\nDiscounts for Athletic Excellence?\\nA 65% discount is granted to fifteen students who excel in athletics. They are selected according to criteria established by the Council of Deans, upon recommendation from the Deanship of Student Affairs at the university. The following is taken into account: 1. The student\\'s GPA on the General Secondary Education Certificate Examination. 2. The university\\'s need for the sport in which they excel. 3. The student\\'s proficiency in the game and passing the university\\'s level test, provided they are a member or player on national teams, first-division clubs, or education directorate teams in the same year they register at the university.\\nIf a student retakes a subject they passed and fails it after the retake, which of the two marks is counted?\\nThe higher mark is counted.\\n\\nIs it permissible for a student to study one or more subjects at another university?\\nZarqa University students are permitted to study no more than (36) credit hours at a recognized university. These credit hours are counted according to the following conditions:\\nThe student must be a regular student at Zarqa University and registered there.\\nThe student must have successfully completed at least 24 credit hours at Zarqa University.\\nThe student must obtain approval from their department to study the required subjects.\\nThe student\\'s grade in each of these subjects must not be less than 60%.\\nThe grades for these subjects are not included in his cumulative GPA.\\nThe student\\'s last two semesters must be at Zarqa University.\\nWhat are the upper and lower limits for registered subjects?\\nThe minimum number of credit hours a student may study is (12) credit hours per semester. With the dean\\'s approval, students may study (9) credit hours. Students whose graduation at the end of that semester depends on completing a fewer number of credit hours are exempt from this requirement.\\nThe student\\'s academic load at the university is (18) credit hours, which we consider a maximum for the first and second semesters.
