The journal has had an Impact Factor since 2010, making it the only scientific journal in Jordan indexed by this international institution.
The Arab International Conference on Information Technology (ACIT) is a peer-reviewed scientific conference specializing in the field of information technology. It is held annually in December of each year at an Arab university.
