- A student may submit a request to postpone their studies before the start of the semester they wish to postpone, using a form prepared for this purpose by the Deanship of Admissions and Registration. Four intermittent semesters and six consecutive semesters may be postponed, but these are not counted as part of the period allowed for obtaining a bachelor's degree.
