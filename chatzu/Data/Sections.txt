The Computer Science major emerged as a result of recent technological advancements in the world. It is defined as the discipline in which students analyze systems and algorithms, and study computer hardware, software, and the complex processes that occur within a computer. The study of this major also includes skills in planning, analysis, organization, comparison, the ability to prove, demonstrate, solve problems, and design programming languages. It is the science that studies computing, data processing, theories, and applications. The abbreviation CS is used to describe it. The Department of Computer Science was established after the founding of Zarqa University in 1994. It focuses on using theoretical and practical methods to process and transmit information via computers. Graduates are awarded a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The department places great emphasis on the quality of education and its outcomes. It has qualified faculty members in the most important academic fields of computer science, and multiple laboratories and classrooms equipped with the latest equipment necessary to provide the best service to our students. The Computer Science major focuses on building specialized knowledge in the field of computers, preparing students to work in programming, computer networks, and the development of various computer systems in various official institutions, as well as private institutions and companies. Students also take courses that build their programming knowledge. They study a number of advanced programming languages, the foundations of designing and analyzing algorithms, data structures, object-oriented and visual programming, and database systems. They also learn about the latest methods of systems analysis and design, using the latest systems used for this purpose. The Computer Science Department includes classrooms equipped with projectors and air conditioning, and computer labs equipped with all applicable computer software, projectors, and smart boards. Finally, students complete their studies in this major by completing an applied project, employing the skills and knowledge they have learned during their undergraduate studies, thus qualifying them to successfully enter the job market.
Since the 2002/2003 academic year, Zarqa University has established a Software Engineering major to meet the needs of the labor market and support the community by facilitating the use of various software to meet the requirements of daily life. Studying software engineering provides students with the necessary concepts and skills needed in the job market to engineer software system requirements and then design, develop, and manage systems of various sizes and types.

Building and developing computer systems requires precision, skill, and great care to avoid errors during system development that could cause material and human losses. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to facilitate the use of computer systems, both from the perspective of users and those responsible for maintaining and developing them. Therefore, the existence of a field of knowledge concerned with developing methodologies, techniques, and tools to ensure the quality and reliability of all stages of system development and that the system fulfills its intended purpose has become essential. Specialists have come to call this field of knowledge "software engineering," and the specialist in this field is called a software engineer.

The Department of Software Engineering at Zarqa University offers a full-time undergraduate program in Software Engineering. Students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 132 credit hours. The department also offers a full-time Master's program in Software Engineering, both thesis and comprehensive, and students are awarded a certificate in Software Engineering after successfully completing 33 credit hours.

The department includes two highly equipped laboratories, including a Software Engineering Tools Laboratory and a Terminal Laboratory, in addition to several PC laboratories. The department constantly strives to update and expand its various equipment. The various laboratories are connected via a modern fiber optic network connected to servers running Unix, Linux, and Windows. The department also includes a group of faculty members with extensive academic and practical teaching experience and a high level of research and knowledge capabilities. The Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence was established in the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year. This decision came in response to significant and significant global developments in this field. This specialization began with 25 students, and the department now includes more than 200 students enrolled in the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program.

Zarqa University has been a pioneer in this field, being the second Jordanian university to establish a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence program. The program's curriculum was developed after a comprehensive study of AI programs at Arab and foreign universities and an examination of the most widespread AI applications worldwide. The plan aims to enable students to build intelligent systems that can be used in various areas of life.

These days, the world is living under a single space (the internet) that facilitates social, economic, and other aspects of life. Therefore, it was necessary to develop academic programs that qualify students to keep pace with current developments in cyberspace by developing secure, highly efficient, and effective internet applications. Accordingly, the university decided to establish the Department of Internet Technology, starting at the beginning of the 2010/2011 academic year. Starting with the second semester of the 2021/2022 academic year, the name was changed to Cybersecurity.

The goal of the Cybersecurity Department is to provide students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills required in the field of cybersecurity and the development of efficient and effective internet and smartphone applications. The program also seeks to address the shortage of practical skills required by the labor markets in the field of cybersecurity and technology.
